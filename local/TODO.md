1. (NEVER DONE) Add more unit tests.
2. Implement ZIGGURAT_CARD_USED statistics.
3. When ziggurats are scored, highlight the ziggurat hex being scored
4. When choosing city/zigs to score manually, highlight the choice
5. Add a confirmation (timed) to ziggurat card selection.
6. Add a (optional) timed confirmation for "end turn"
7. Consider re-working representation and have explicit DIVs for all pieces (ziggurats, cities, player pieces). This could facilitate animations.
