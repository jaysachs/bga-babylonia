1. (NEVER DONE) Add more unit tests.
2. Implement ZIGGURAT_CARD_USED statistics.
3. When choosing city/zigs to score manually, highlight the chosen one. Do this via notify from appropriate arg/state functions.
4. Add a confirmation (timed) to ziggurat card selection.
5. Add a (optional?) timed confirmation for "end turn"
6. Consider re-working representation and have explicit DIVs for all pieces (ziggurats, cities, player pieces). This could facilitate animations.
7. Make ziggurat card choices from the status bar (optionally also let choosing from the display). Then can have the confirm countdown.
8. When scoring ziggurats, briefly highlight ("blink") the adjacent pieces, clearly identifying the winner.
9. During city scoring, highlight the adjacent pieces & winner before capturing the piece.
