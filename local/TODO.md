1. (NEVER DONE) Add more unit tests.
2. Implement ZIGGURAT_CARD_USED statistics.
3. When ziggurats are scored, highlight the ziggurat hex being scored
4. When choosing city/zigs to score manually, highlight the choice
5. Add a confirmation (timed) to ziggurat card selection.
6. Add a (optional) timed confirmation for "end turn"
7. Consider re-working representation and have explicit DIVs for all pieces (ziggurats, cities, player pieces). This could facilitate animations.
8. Verify rules on placing multiple farmers, particularly around capturing fields. Right now implementation is inconsistent -- can play "last" farmer into field even if 2 already played, but if play field as action 1 or 2, can't play a 3rd farmer.
