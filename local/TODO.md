1. (NEVER DONE) Add more unit tests.
2. Implement ZIGGURAT_CARD_USED statistics.
3. When choosing city/zigs to score manually, highlight the chosen one. Do this via notify from appropriate arg/state functions.
4. Add a confirmation (timed) to ziggurat card selection.
5. Add a (optional?) timed confirmation for "end turn"
6. Consider re-working representation and have explicit DIVs for all pieces (ziggurats, cities, player pieces). This could facilitate animations.
