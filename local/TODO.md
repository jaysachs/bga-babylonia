4 Implement automated scoring hex choices (enabled via game option):
4.1  simple: there's only one hex to score
4.2  complex: score active player won ziggurats, then ask other players cities, then active player cities, then other player ziggurats
6. (NEVER DONE) Add unit tests.
19. Audit all notifications; are they all required? any missing? incomplete?
23. Stats and undo: store as serialized JSON?
25. More granular points stats (aim for adding up breakdown).
